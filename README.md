# OVERSLEPT
You wake up from a dream only to realize you are running late for work (Work is interchangeable with other things like school, date, presentation, competition etc). You climb out of bed and run to your bathroom to freshen up. After you’re clean, you run to the closet to get dressed glancing at your calendar and grab your wallet along the way. Next, you race to the kitchen and decide what to do for lunch. You end up slapping together a sandwich and running for the door, grabbing your keys, briefcase and flash drive. You get in your car, but the battery is dead. You can either try to jumpstart it, catch the bus or ride your bike. You then navigate challenges on your way to work and pick what kind of music you’d like to listen to on the ride. You then reach one of three possible final endings based on your decisions. You either make it to work on time and your boss is happy with your performance, or you show up to work late and get fired. Lastly, if you manage to bungle every choice possible, you may never actually make it to work.
